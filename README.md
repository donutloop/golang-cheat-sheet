```
### Testing

```

Goâ€™s race detector is available from the Go tools via -race. go test also supports this flag and reports races.

```bash
go test -race
```
How to separate go tests

Mark your _test.go files with build constraints:

For instance:
```go
// +build integration

package logger_test

```
Now you can execute your integration tests with the tags flag:
When you don't pass tags only all other tests will be executed!

```bash
go test --tags=integration
```

### Benchmarking


The command below will trigger all benchmarks in your project.

```bash

go test -bench=.

```

The command below will trigger just one benchmark in your project.

```bash

go test -bench={{Name of Benchmark}}

```
